        <h1>David Huang</h1>
        <p>My work explores themes of human relationships, isolation, and loneliness in the modern world. Heavily inspired by science fiction, neo-noir, and Hong Kong New Wave cinema, I portray these themes by tying the past and future into our current societal moment, examining how broader issues of identity, technology, and politics contribute to our modern sense of isolation. I express this via the media of film and photography, creating imagery that aims to evoke a sense of isolation while inviting the viewer to consider how such emotions are interrelated with broader societal issues.</p>
