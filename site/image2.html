        <p>I took this photo of a small footbridge surrounded by deep snow. The way that the snow rose up to the bridge and was almost the same color stuck out to me. It looks like it leads nowhere and serves no purpose thanks to the inches of snow around it. Yet, it is obviously well traveled judging by the foorprints. I cropped the image so that it would fit in the rule of thirds and lightly color graded it to to increase the blue channels, giving it colder tones to suggest an atmosphere of loneliness.</p>
