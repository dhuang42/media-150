        <p>This is a photo I took of one of the dormer windows of Alice Austen House, the former home of the eponymous queer street photographer. I chose this image not only because I live nearby this landmark and Alice Austen is an inspiration to me as a photographer, but also because I am fascinated by architecture. I find architectural lines lend themselves very well to photographic compositions. I used a telephoto lens to create a tight shot that compresses the space between the fascia of the roof, the window, and the trees looming in the background. Framing this image using the rule of thirds, I hoped to bring out the architectural details of this one part of the house.</p>
