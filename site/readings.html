        <h1>Reflection on "In Plato's Cave"</h1>
        <p>As a photography enthusiast myself, Susan Sontag’s essay “In Plato’s Cave” was both insightful and challenging to read. In it, Sontag likens photographs to Plato’s allegory of the cave, arguing that photographs represent a false, distorted reality much like the shadows seen by the prisoners trapped inside the cave. However, while many of Sontag’s points have merit and are well argued, I cannot ultimately agree with with her perspective on nature of photography and its role as a representation of truth. Sontag’s argument mainly comes from the point of view that photography is an act of documentation and journalism, and she mostly ignores the merits of photography as an art form which can create new meaning. To me, photographing something is not simply an act of recording what is already there; it is an act of expression and interpretation that has merit in its own right.</p>
        <p>Sontag raises many points that I broadly agree with. She observes that people trust photographs as a record of the truth, saying that we believe, “A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened.” There are indeed many ways people use photographs as proof that something occurred. People take photographs of their vacations, weddings, and other events to show that they were there. Photographs are also used as identification by governments, as evidence by police, and so on. This assessment is fairly self-evident, as I am sure that almost everyone views having photographic evidence of something makes it seem more trustworthy.</p>
        <p>However, Sontag argues that a photograph cannot accurately portray the truth and while she is right in saying so, I disagree with how she ultimately depicts this as a failing of photography. She argues, “Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are.” Certainly, the photographer’s choice of lenses, focal length, f-stop, shutter speed, and even the camera itself will affect the photograph being taken – the camera less so “captures” what is in front of it than it does interpret it. And, of course, there is also interpretation in choosing what to photograph and what is left out. I understand this point implicitly. A photography teacher once taught me to be mindful of what isn’t being photographed. She even said that if I see a group of people all trying to take a picture of something, maybe I should point my camera at them rather than their subject.</p>
        <p>Sontag sees the camera’s inability to capture the whole truth as its downfall; the camera can only create false images like the ones in Plato’s cave. If I saw photography as merely a journalistic practice, I might be inclined to agree. But photography is also an art form, even as it seeks to document the world. For example, Bill Cunningham’s iconic street photography is much more than a documentation of the fashion trends of the times. His subjects are often expressive, his shot composition has its own style, and his choice of candid photography has meaning all on its own. Cunningham is quoted as saying, "The best fashion show is definitely on the street. Always has been and always will be." That is not a journalistic observation of the truth, but an artistic statement. One which he conveyed through his own unique style. Photography interprets the real world and creates new meaning from it. Sontag is right when she says this is not “truth.” However, I choose see this as one of its strengths.</p>
